    Hola GitHub Fam! :octocat: 
    I'm passionate about learning Python. I recently completed the 'Python for Data Science, AI & Development' course. While I haven't embarked on any major projects yet, I've been diligently working on mini practice codes to solidify my understanding of Python concepts.</p>

  <h2>My Practice :pushpin: </h2>
  <p>You can check out my practice on this repository where I upload mini coding exercises and projects.</p>
  <p>Feel free to explore and provide feedback :raised_hands:  </p>
  <p>I'm continuously learning and improving, and I'm excited about my journey in the world of Python programming.</p>
